## TODO

### Clean up repo


### Improve and accelerate text to image generation

- Research and try other modules


### Improve and accelerate image to SVG conversion

- Rewrite the `primitive` lib in C++ with CUDA
- Look for other ways to convert


### Improve aesthetic patch score

- Figure out better ways to patch the image
    - Better clip-path
    - Larger regions for much higher score
    - Improve results with lower amount of paths
- Try global transforms that improve aesthetic score


### Try a different approach

- Research new methods
    - SVGDreamer
    - Chat to SVG


### Ensemble

- Run multiple image generation + SVG conversions and test against the metric
